### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following actions;

2. Handling missing variables
3. Data Cleaning and Formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as;
- What gender distribution look like grouping by regions and departments?
- what insight do we have on rating base on gender?
- Is there gender pay gap in the salary structure across various departments and regions?
- what is the compliance level of company to the recent regulation of minimum pay of $90,000 for all the manufacturing companies?
- what is the number of employees in each of the category of salary range created?
- what is the total salary to be paid after the implementation of the proposed bonus in each region and in the company-wide? 

 ### Data Analysis and Results

This is where we used some Excel functions notably pivot table and Power BI to perform various analysis used during our work.

### Interpretation of Results
  
  - The male staff are more than the female staff in as many as 7 out of 12 departments across the regions
  - On the average, males were rated higher but females were rated Very Good more than male counterpart
  - In all the regions, male staff are more than the female staff
  - In all locations, the total sum of salary paid to the male staff is greater than the total paid to the female staff. However, this does not mean that the males were better paid than their female colleagues, it only means that the population of the male staff is greater than that of the female staff and so the total amount paid in all the regions.
  - Only 292 out of 946 employees received $90,000 and above before the bonus proposal while just 330 employees will receive $90,000 and above after bonus payment implementation.

### Recommendations

- The Palmora Group should do more in terms of balancing the existing gender inequality by employing more females than males in the subsequent employment process
- The recommendation above is not only to correct the gender inequality but to also get more operational efficiency from the staff since more females were rated "Very Good" than males
- There should be an upward salary review in order to comply with the new regulation

### Conclusion

The Exploratory data analysis conducted for the Palmora Group of Companies has given insight to the insinuations around the gender inequality with the results and interpretations given above. This should guide the management of the company in their employment process policies and staff remuneration in order to stay compliant with the rules and regulations on the government to avert being penalised in terms of fines and litigateion charges.
